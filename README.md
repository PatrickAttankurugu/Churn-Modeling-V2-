# PROJECT STATUS: Active

## Project Intro/Objectives

The purpose of this project is to predict the likelihood that a particular customer will leave the bank. We are also to find out what exactly the bank should do to keep customers and prevent them from leaving. These are the main objectives, however the bank welcomes any other insights found during analysis.


## Methods I am using
* Predictive Modeling
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning 


## Technologies I am using
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sci-Kit Learn
* Numpy
* Jupyter
* Flask
* Posgres
* MySQL
* HTML

## Project Description

The data originally belongs to a bank that operates in 3 countries: France, Spain and Germany. But since most of my audience are likely to come from Ghana, I decided to replace the geography variables with Accra, Kumasi and Bolga respectiveloy for easy comprehension. So in the dataset you will see these three Ghanaian regions instead of the countries.
Now the bank has been experiencing a rapid rate of customer churn lately. That means custmers have been leaving the bank at an unusual rate and managemnent want to find out what is wrong, and what they can do to keep their customers. I completed the prototype of this project with a software tool called Gretl. But here, I will be using Python and related libraries.

This project is an application of the logistic regression algorithm. We are trying to compute the binary outcome of whether or not a particular customer will leave the bank. I used a machine learning library called Sci-kit Learn. But Sci-kit Learn is built on top of matplotlib which in turn is built on top of Numpy. So you need some experience with Numpy, matplotlib and sci-kit learn. You will also need some introductory knowledge in pandas to get started with this project.





###Vision
This is version 2 of the churn modeling project. The vision is to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave the bank and determine what to do to keep them and reduce churn rate drastically.

### About The Data

Data Source: https://www.superdatascience.com/training/pages . (section 5)

Number of rows in train data: 10,000
Number of rows in test data: 1,000
Number of columns: 13



### Outcome 
The code is supposed to predict the likelihood that a particular customer or group of customers will leave the bank.

# LET'S CONNECT

I am a big fan of the phylosophy that nothing just happens. If you are reading this. Chances are that we are meant to connect. probably, you can be classified under one of three categories if you are a Data Scientist. Beginner, intermediate or advanced. If you are a beginner, go ahead and clone this repository and try to understand and reproduce the codes that are used to perform various functions within the project. Remember to chat me up [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-attankurugu-b17a60151/) when you need help . I will be more than ready to help you understand the logistic regression algorithm used in this project. Should you want to join me in the project, You are welcome. Fork it and let's get analyzing.
